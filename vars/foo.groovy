// House keeping:
// --------------
// 1. Anything in vars/ is going to be a global-var 
// from Jenkins' perspective.
//
// 2. The name of this file = the name of the step
// we want to call in the pipeline file.
//
// 3. This file has to be .groovy but it doesn't
// have to be a Groovy script.
//
// 4. You can create a '.txt' that matches the
// .groovy file name nd that'd be the help
// that'd shows up in the global variables.
